<h2 id='relevance_to_archaeology'>Relevance to Archaeology</h2>

<p>If there ever was a social science that needed an explicit body of methods for scaling individual-level social theory to large-scale patterns, it&#8217;s archaeology. Archaeologists are continually attempting to formulate and use individual-level models of social processes. Whether this is foraging theory, game theory, evolutionary theory, or something more nebulous, we are borrowers of microscopic theory from other social and natural sciences.</p>

<p>But our empirical record is not even remotely reflective of the scale at which those microscopic social processes act. We observe a macroscopic record whose &#8220;characteristic scale&#8221; is many times the time scale of the social processes we use as explanations, and aggregating together many events that are the result of many people.</p>

<p>We also observe that record using analytical classifications and variables which are chosen for convenience and have no systematic or provable relationship to any hypothetical &#8220;units&#8221; in the past.</p>

<h2 id='basic_concept'>Basic Concept</h2>

<p>If we strip away all of the terminology which is specific to renormalization problems in specific theoretical realms (e.g., QFT or condensed matter physics), the principle is simple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Renormalization is the formal analysis of how to describe a system&#8217;s dynamics, through a measurement process, at different scales of observation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two things are important here:</p>

<ol>
<li>The way we observe a system normally needs to be part of our model of the system.</li>

<li>The &#8220;scale&#8221; of our observational methods determines aspects of the quantitative relationships we will measure about a system.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first point has been central to physical theory since the development of quantum theory, but is relevant to all systems. It&#8217;s just that when we talk about systems described at a single scale that is the same as our measurement scale, and when the measurement process does not perturb the measured system, we can usually &#8220;factor out&#8221; the details of measurement.</p>

<p>The second point is less well understood, but is pretty much a consequence of the first. Our measurement processes operate at &#8220;characteristic scales,&#8221; and typically there is some kind of &#8220;cutoff scale&#8221; at which we cannot observe details that are smaller, faster, or higher in frequency. But our inability to measure or observe those details doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t influence or even determine the dynamics at larger scales, so we need to account or them somehow, not just ignore them.</p>

<p>Renormalization is the process of &#8220;integrating out&#8221; the effects of physics below a cutoff scale. To use an example from Susskind, if we&#8217;re trying to describe physics at the scale of atoms and molecules, we&#8217;re not concerned with the details of how quarks form nucleons. And if we&#8217;re interested in the properties of a volume of liquid, we&#8217;re not terribly interested in how electrons and nucleons are put together to form atoms.</p>

<p>It turns out that we can&#8217;t simply <em>ignore</em> the effect of the smaller/faster scales, however. We need, instead, to understand how to <em>scale</em> our understanding of the dynamics at a given level to our observational methods, averaging over all the stuff below the cutoff.</p>

<h2 id='basic_process'>Basic Process</h2>

<p>The goal is to integrate out the fast and small degrees of freedom, and use a &#8220;mean-field&#8221; type approximation for all the fast/small stuff as the basis for a dynamical description of the whole at a higher level (see above).</p>

<p>In practice this mean:</p>

<ol>
<li>Separate scales</li>

<li>Separate processes</li>

<li>Summarize scales and processes occurring fast &amp; small</li>

<li>Rewrite the description of the entire system using the summarized description of fast/small dynamics instead of the detailed contributions of fast/small entities</li>

<li>Find new high level observables for this renormalized description</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='separate_scales'>Separate Scales</h3>

<p>This is primarily time scales, but it&#8217;s also distance scales. So, basically in our case, it&#8217;s separation of spatiotemporal scales.</p>

<p>As a prime example, assume we are investigating regional variation in ceramic assemblages, with assemblages representing chunks of time from residential communities (e.g., late prehistoric nucleated villages).</p>

<p>The resolution of our observations is necessarily coarse-grained in such cases: the frequencies of analytical classes for each assemblage, which is equivalent to treating the <strong>average</strong> frequency of each class as constant over the duration of the assemblage (in the absence of data about artifact accumulation rates by artifact class).</p>

<p>Given this level of observational resolution:</p>

<ol>
<li>We probably cannot meaningfully differentiate models and hypotheses which describe individual-level variation, unless those theories display strong phase transitions whose character is distinguishable at macro scales. <em>Whether a process model does have a sharp phase transition which can be distinguished at longer, averaged scales, is something that must be investigated for each process model. No generic answer is possible.</em></li>

<li>We need an &#8220;averaged&#8221; description of possible lower level transmission models, weighted by their frequency or prevalence, to drive the higher level description.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id='separate_processes'>Separate Processes</h3>

<p>This is related to separating scales, actually. Think about Susskind&#8217;s example of the two atoms interacting. Ideally the Hamiltonian is composed of a sum of terms, referring to the effects of different processes or components, and we can make a decision about whether a given process is part of the &#8220;fast&#8221; or &#8220;slow&#8221; stuff, and renormalize it out accordingly.</p>

<p>So the point here is simply that we have to watch our theory-building carefully and try not to have terms in the Hamiltonian which combine fast and slow things into the same term, this can make it hard to renormalize (I&#8217;m pretty sure, I&#8217;m inferring that given what I know at this stage of the game).</p>
