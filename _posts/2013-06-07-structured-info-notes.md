The bits of information that go into any real skill, behavior, or complex artifact display many types of semantic relationships.  What I'm interested in are _classes_ of relationships among those bits of information, where the classes affect the patterns of spreading, persistence, generative entrenchment, or openness to innovation for the bits of information.

(Aside:  I really need a better term for the "bits of information", because I refuse to call them "memes," and they're not really _units_in the observational sense.)

This is just a first set of notes, so I'm not making a claim yet that these are the correct set of _minimal_ classes of relationships.  These seem like obvious candidates for exploration, however.  Some of these may turn out to have identical distributional consequences, others may differ.

If two semantic relationships have identical distribution consequences, it doesn't mean that the relationships aren't an important distinction in cognitive and developmental terms.  It simply means that the distinction has equifinalities using distributional measures at population scales.

Our knowledge (about skills and artifacts) is clearly modular in many respects, although it often doesn't start out that way.  Prototypes are often simply the result of some trial and error and directed learning, and we "modularize" the results when we're trying to package it up to "assembly line" it or teach it.  But by the time a skill or artifact is widespread within a population, you can bet that its components are at least weaky modularized, especially if there are specializations involved in production or construction.

Recipes are often composed of modules, but the recipe itself is algorithmic in a way that modules themselves need not be.  Many artifact production processes are actually combinations of recipes that specify steps which are modular and possibly involve sub-steps and sub-modules, for example. 

Prerequisite information and widely used modules are key examples of generative entrenchment in cultural information.  Such information has deep persistence and often resistance to alteration (although we often repackage it in synonymous or equivalent ways to enhance its learnability or reduce the skill level required to employ it).  

Abstraction is another important way in which we increase the scope of learning -- instead of teaching redundant information for every concrete case, we often abstract out the common elements and learn them separately.  This may be a very late element in cultural learning, but I need to think more about that.  Think about learning electrical engineering -- we teach principles of circuit design and electronics, which students can then apply to constructing a radio or other device.  

Abstractions are then ripe for being turned into prerequisites, of course...
