<p>The basic idea here: we cannot model cultural transmission, as it is really implemented in humans, by acting like traits are alleles at genetic loci. Such models were important, because they gave us a <em>modeling framework</em> within which we can analyze CT models, but neutral Wright-Fisher or the SIS/contact model are not CT.</p>

<p>The simplest reason why we cannot simply use WF/SIS and variants to accurately model culture is, (1) that such models treat culture as if everybody had &#8220;variants&#8221; of, and when people acquire a new variant, they get rid of their old one (i.e., some form of detailed balance holds), and (2) that such models assume that the cultural repertoire is held as &#8220;live&#8221; variants in individuals, like the genetic repertoire, and thus inventorying the population will give you a variant per individual, period, while the real situation is that people can hold multiple variants or have &#8220;mixed strategies&#8221; over a spectrum of traits, and we can also store traits outside our bodies, in the form of artifacts.</p>

<p>Fixing #1 must be done carefully, since giving up detailed balance gives us stochastic models which are much harder to analyze, since they often have no stationary distribution and frequently are non-ergodic. It means we&#8217;ll mostly understand models which relax detailed balance in certain cases where we can directly solve the relevant master equations, or that we&#8217;ll mostly understand such models through simulation.</p>

<p>Fixing #2 can be done by incorporating a reservoir of objects outside the state space of individuals holding their own traits, and incorporating a rule whereby individuals occasionally copy each other directly, occasionally copy some object they observe, and occasionally innovating on their own traits, or innovating off an object used as a model.</p>

<p>This would seem to cover a 2x2 matrix of possible interactions between individuals, objects, and traits. If one reduces the number of objects to zero, and assuming a &#8220;detailed balance&#8221; model for trait kinetics, then we are back to a standard genetic model like WF or Moran.</p>

<p>But we can alter the mix of the various rules by altering their rates, so we have a phase space including each as dimensions.</p>

<p>This can be implemented by using a Population and an ArtifactSpace, with the latter implemented as a tuple space.</p>

<p>An artifact would be made, by an individual, at some rate, out of a combination of traits held by that individual, and placed in the tuplespace.</p>

<p>Initially, artifacts would have a single average use-life, before they expire out of the tuplespace. Artifacts don&#8217;t live forever.</p>

<p>Artifacts would be represented in the tuplespace by variables:</p>

<p>Traits: list Creator: agentID</p>

<p>We might have rules, for example, that allow individuals to query their own artifacts out of tuplespace, and copy them, or perhaps to query everybody else&#8217;s artifacts, or neighbor&#8217;s artifacts. This would allow adjustment of rules about copying.</p>

<p>We need three sets of observables: stats on traits held by individuals, traits in artifacts, and the combination of both.</p>
