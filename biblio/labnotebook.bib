	posterior distributions without having to calculate likelihoods.
	In this paper, we discuss and apply an ABC method based on sequential
	Monte Carlo (SMC) to estimate parameters of dynamical models. We
	show that ABC SMC provides information about the inferability of
	parameters and model sensitivity to changes in parameters, and tends
	to perform better than other ABC approaches. The algorithm is applied
	to several well-known biological systems, for which parameters and
	their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC
	as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical
	descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the
	standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},

@article{Lipo2015,
	Abstract = {<p>Frequency seriation played a key role in the formation of archaeology
	as a discipline due to its ability to generate chronologies. Interest
	in its utility for exploring issues of contemporary interest beyond
	chronology, however, has been limited. This limitation is partly
	due to a lack of quantitative algorithms that can be used to build
	deterministic seriation solutions. When the number of assemblages
	becomes greater than just a handful, the resources required for evaluation
	of possible permutations easily outstrips available computing capacity.
	On the other hand, probabilistic approaches to creating seriations
	offer a computationally manageable alternative but rely upon a compressed
	description of the data to order assemblages. This compression removes
	the ability to use all of the features of our data to fit to the
	seriation model, obscuring violations of the model, and thus lessens
	our ability to understand the degree to which the resulting order
	is chronological, spatial, or a mixture. Recently, frequency seriation
	has been reconceived as a general method for studying the structure
	of cultural transmission through time and across space. The use of
	an evolution-based framework renews the potential for seriation but
	also calls for a computationally feasible algorithm that is capable
	of producing solutions under varying configurations, without manual
	trial and error fitting. Here, we introduce the Iterative Deterministic
	Seriation Solution (IDSS) for constructing frequency seriations,
	an algorithm that dramatically constrains the search for potential
	valid orders of assemblages. Our initial implementation of IDSS does
	not solve all the problems of seriation, but begins to moves towards
	a resolution of a long-standing problem in archaeology while opening
	up new avenues of research into the study of cultural relatedness.
	We demonstrate the utility of IDSS using late prehistoric decorated
	ceramics from the Mississippi River Valley. The results compare favorably
	to previous analyses but add new details into the structure of cultural
	transmission of these late prehistoric populations.</p>},
