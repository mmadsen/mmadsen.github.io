<h2 id='overall_notes'>Overall notes</h2>

<p>Murray&#8217;s conclusion is very thought provoking (as is Bailey&#8217;s chapter).</p>

<p>Murray lumps evolutionary archaeology in with the prevailing paradigm of &#8220;archaeology as anthropology&#8221;, and that&#8217;s probably fair because although we know we need a new metaphysic, and have described the meta-theoretical requirements for one, we haven&#8217;t really produced one yet. We keep slipping back into evolutionary ecological theory. Although the cladistics work on branching of the cultural information flow might warrant a serious re-look as one foundation of a timelike paradigm.</p>

<p>With respect to CT itself, the major challenge is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Stop exclusively using models which require parameters we cannot estimate or measure, especially independently of each other (e.g., N, or mu).</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Develop a time-like set of expectations for things we can actually measure.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Build bridges between ecological time theory and those time-like expectations.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='current_thinking'>Current Thinking</h2>

<p>A really basic problem is that folks have been trying to use CT models that require ecological parameterization to say things about &#8220;how much variation we should expect&#8221; in the record. And then making claims about CT processes and thus social aspects of past societies based upon deviations from those expectations.</p>

<p>But we haven&#8217;t demonstrated that we can securely tie &#8220;how much variation to expect&#8221; to both a model and the record.</p>

<ul>
<li>This gets to empirical insufficiency (and thus dynamic insufficiency) of models</li>

<li>Impedance mismatch between models and the record &#8211; time perspectivism/time-like vs. space-like.</li>

<li>Lack of proper focus on unit formation and how units, time scales, and model quantities interact</li>
</ul>

<p>Investigate:</p>

<ol>
<li>Models where we don&#8217;t need to know N and mu, and instead look at &#8220;how much variation&#8221; there is depending upon time scale of observation and granularity of classification &#8211; at at least three levels of granularity to establish scaling relations</li>

<li>Take an explicitly statistical physical view of these scaling relationships &#8211; we&#8217;re looking for &#8220;phase transitions&#8221; and difference phases of behavior in these scaling relationships; models which have the same scaling behavior ultimately can&#8217;t be differentiated in a time-perspective record and are thus equifinal.</li>
</ol>

<p>The central problem is defining <strong>CT models which do not require parameters unrecoverable from archaeological sources, and which have direct empirical implication for palimpsest deposits</strong>, given flexibility on things like determining deposit duration, choosing classificatory schemes (and possibly more than one).</p>

<p>The result may not be able to make predictions about any specific assemblage, but should be able to make predictions about sets of assemblages relative to one another &#8211; flows within metacommunities over time.</p>

<p>Richness itself is highly affected by time-averaging in palimpsests, evenness affected but less so. What we need to study is the scaling of sets of richness and evenness values across groups of assemblages.</p>
