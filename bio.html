<h2>About the Author</h2>

<p>Mark E. Madsen is an anthropologist, evolutionary biologist, technology entrepreneur, and software engineer living in the San Juan Islands of Washington State. </p>

<p>I'm currently completing my Ph.D. in anthropology at the University of Washington.  I began my doctorate under the mentorship of Robert C. Dunnell in 1988, while completing my master's degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Dr. Dunnell sadly passed away in Dec 2010, and my committee now consists of Drs. James Feathers, Ben Marwick, Carl Bergstrom, and Carl Lipo. </p> 

<p>Between 1995 and 2006, I worked in a variety of capacities in Seattle-based software and data networking companies. I was a founding or very early engineer at RealNetworks, Internap Network Services, and GridNetworks.  I co-founded AllRecipes.com (as Emergent Media, Inc) with Carl Lipo, Tim Hunt, Dan Shepherd, David Quinn, and Michael Pfeffer, and I co-founded Network Clarity with Christopher D. Wheeler.  I served in a variety of management, board, and engineering roles in these companies.  Most recently, I worked briefly at Microsoft in the Windows Enterprise Management Division, on new product initiatives and technology licensing and acquisitions.  </p>

<p>My research focuses on the ways Darwinian evolutionary theory needs to be expanded or modified to include culture and language as systems of heritable transmission. I worked briefly in the Ohio River valley, spent 5 years working with Robert Dunnell in the central Mississippi River valley, worked with Julie K. Stein in the San Juan Islands, and did a stint in Pakistan at Harappa with Mark Kenoyer and George Dales. I was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research fellow, and received my B.A. (cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa) from the Univ. of Washington in 1988 and my M.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1990.</p>

<p>On a personal note, I serve as a member of the Board of Trustees (and past Board President) for the San Juan Island Library District, am a past Chair and board member for the San Juan Islands Agricultural Guild, and currently (2013-2014) serve as Board President and director of Seattle Arts and Lectures.  My partner Nicole lives in Seattle with her daughter, is a specialist in Emergency Medicine, and is co-founder and a managing partner in Eastside Emergency Physicians.</p>
