Five Classical Approaches to the Evolution of Culture
-----------------------------------------------------

### Human sociobiology

-   Response to the naive group-selectionism in ethology. Cooperation in
    social behavior the central paradox – spawned generations of
    research on altruism and cooperation.
-   Models of reciprocal altruism, parent-offspring conflict, kin
    selection, and the methods of evolutionary game theory.
-   Hugely controversial applied to humans, although the theoretical
    content of sociobiology has been essentially baked into all
    non-social science analysis of the evolution of behavior

### Human behavioral ecology

-   Attempt to gather data on whether human behavior was adaptive
-   To what extent are behavioral differences responses to particular
    environments?
-   Adaptive behavior is functional behavior that increments
    reproductive success
-   This is different than an adaptation, which is a character which was
    shaped by selection for its effectiveness in a particular role.

### Evolutionary psychology

-   EP tends to see human cognition and cultural processing capabilities
    as past adaptations to the environment in which humanity evolved.
-   Environment of evolutionary adaptedness: - stable psychological
    mechanisms evolved in response to stable features of the ancestral
    environment.
-   Gradualism - minds are build from co-adapted gene complexes that are
    unable to respond quickly to selection. Suggests that humans
    experience “adaptive lag”
-   Massive modularity - the mind consists of domain-specific, modular
    programmes, with much less emphasis (or denial of) a general-purpose
    cognitive module or structure.
-   Universal human nature - the evolved modules are responsible for
    producing a species-specific human nature. Different outcomes emerge
    from this universal human nature through triggering by social and
    environmental conditions, leading to universal behavioral outcomes
    and locally specified adaptive solutions.
-   Current behavior is produced by these adaptations, but may not be
    currently adaptive in the HBE sense.
-   Critiques of the EEA focus on the fact that selection has operated
    continuously and changed human genomes over the last several
    thousand years in significant ways. There is no reason to assume
    that cognition is a frozen remnant of adaptation to an EEA.
-   However, the notion that there are psychological modules or
    tendencies, or learning biases, is probably a useful one if divorced
    from the idea of past adaptations. These psych tendencies and biases
    appear in “dual inheritance” theory as well, given the psych
    background of the B&R clade.

### Memetics

-   Memetics itself is a research program which considers cultural
    information (memes) to be a distinct and parallel set of
    replicators. This research program applies formal Darwinism to
    cultural information in the absence of interaction with genetics or
    selective forces caused by fecundity or death of biological
    organisms.
-   Even more strongly, memetics is an attempt to use “replicator” as
    indicative not of a class of processes, but to claim that culture is
    made up of particulate information which is replicated in a
    high-fidelity manner. Memes are phenomenological in some fashion in
    this view.
-   It originated by taking Dawkins’s notion of the “gene’s eye view”
    (genetic selectionism) seriously as a parallel for cultural
    information.
-   This leads to “culture as virus” theories, where humans are more a
    substrate that memes inhabit than an integrated phenotypic system.
-   Principal issue within “classical memetics” is a lack of a serious,
    cumulative empirical body of knowledge, and not much methodological
    development. Much of the early memetics literature is devoted to
    “just-so” stories and reframing cultural phenomena in presumptively
    memetic terms.
-   Major criticism of memetics: evolution requires descent with
    modification (i.e., heritability), not replication in any strict
    sense.

### Gene-Culture Coevolution / Dual-Inheritance Theory

-   Gene-culture coevolution describes theories in which both systems of
    inheritance are modeled in parallel, in order to capture phenomena
    which span both systems.
-   Canonical example: lactose tolerance genetically followed the
    cultural practice of dairy farming.
-   Much of Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, and some of Boyd and
    Richerson’s, work falls into this category. But some aspects of
    “dual inheritance theory” (i.e., transmission biases) also are
    useful in “pure” CT theory.
-   Archy CT folks who are not “UW Tradition” are usually DI theorists,
    but given the nature of our data and phenomena, we usually employ
    only the pure cultural side of the DI models.

Approaches as Seen Within Archaeology
-------------------------------------

### Collard

-   Selectionist archaeology
-   Compiled by Lumsden and Wilson in 1981, refs in Laland and Brown
    2006
-   Idea
-   Mnemotype
-   Idene
-   Sociogene
-   Instruction
-   Cultural type
-   Meme
-   Concept
-   Culturgen
-   Dual-inheritance theory
-   HBE
-   But Collard himself is mainly interested in applying phylogenetic
    methods and tracing macroevolutionary pattern, likely considering
    himself part of the dual-inheritance school.

Opposition to Darwinian Views of Culture
----------------------------------------

-   Aunger (2000) - disputes on three levels:
-   Whether culture is properly seen as composed of independently
    transmitted information units
-   Whether these so-called memes have the necessary qualifications to
    serve as replicators
-   Whether a Darwinian or selectionist approach such as memetics is the
    most feasible or desirable form for a science of culture to take.

Sober’s Three Selection Models
------------------------------

-   Type 1: heritability through genes, fitness through biological
    reproduction
-   Type 2: heritability through learning, fitness through biological
    reproduction
-   Type 3: heritability through learning, fitness through cultural
    replication
-   “Models of transmission systems describe the quantitative
    consequences of systems of cultural influence.” …. Evolutionary
    theory is much less unified when we consider what it has to say
    about the sources of fitness differences….evolutionary theory
    achieves its greatest generality when it ignores sources and focuses
    on consequences.

Summing Up
----------

Aunger (2000) neatly describes what I think is the core problem in the
debates over evolutionary explanations for culture (which seem largely
over in archaeology now that we’re in a “big tent” phase of theory
coexistence).

He describes a general debate in the social sciences: “whether culture
can be treated strictly as socially transmitted information in the first
place.”

-   Culture need not be solely composed of “socially transmitted
    information” for an evolutionary approach to be useful.
-   Evolutionary theory is not, strictly speaking, a theory about
    “sources” but about “consequences” – it is a theory or theories
    which describe the macro consequences of constructing micro theories
    that combine individual variation, processes operative locally
    within populations, and heritability.
-   Even in genetic inheritance, not all of the relevant context for
    determining consequences is “genetically transmitted” – some is
    epigenetic, some is environmental, and some is contextual given
    population structure. And the theories of population genetics and
    natural selection themselves are silent about how these other
    information structures arise and operate – other bodies of theory
    are necessary to describe that.
-   Even those aspects of culture which are “socially transmitted” and
    thus explicable using a flow/diffusion/heritability framework
    combined with population thinking, need not be strictly or solely
    “particulate” or discrete.
-   This follows from the previous observation, but makes the point that
    heritability is a matter of information-theoretic correlation
    derived from direct causation, rather than probabilistic
    convergence. Observations about the “particulate” nature of genetic
    inheritance are really separate from this given the “blending vs
    particulate” argument in the early days of Mendelism. Many
    phenotypic characters which are genetically coded are not
    particulate, and there’s some point at which a polygenic character
    with epigenetic modification ceases to be meaningfully “particulate”
    in the simple way we normally mean that. So it’s not clear to me
    that the subset of social information which is actually copied or
    learned (as opposed to the other aspects of a cultural phenomenon
    which need not be copied to be part of cultural inheritance), need
    to be “particulate” at all.
-   The upshot to me is that a lot of the memetics literature, and
    critics of an evolutionary perspective in general, spent a good deal
    of time on these issues while using overly simplified genetic
    analogies to make their points.
-   And much of this literature completely ignores
    ideational/phenomenological distinctions, and the roles of different
    theories and models in answering specific questions. Asking whether
    “Evolutionary models explain culture” is nonsensical. They can
    explain particular questions about culture.
-   Other theories and models are needed in other cases – keeping in
    mind that if we have a theory for the source or structure of a
    phenomenon, if that theory is consistent with population thinking,
    it might become *part of* an evolutionary explanation down the road.
    That’s really the sense in which RCD, Lipo, and others are able make
    totalizing statements about evolutionary theory being the right
    theoretical basis for the social sciences, or anthropology, as a
    whole, while avoiding the reductionism they’re often painted with.
    Saying that archaeology ought to be evolutionary is not a statement
    that archaeologists SHOULD ONLY study population genetic models, or
    explain phenomena as adaptations shaped by natural selection.
-   It is a statement that a naturalistic, scientific study of human
    behavior, or artifact production, etc., is naturally a mix of source
    and consequence theories once one accepts population thinking and
    variation as causal. The consequence theories start with population
    genetics-like diffusionist models and selection models, but really
    describe *what happens* when you put together a combination of
    processes. The source theories might be quite functionalist and
    space-like indeed, and encompass a lot of traditional types of
    anthropological theory – the big difference being that most source
    theories in anthropology are essentialist and need revision for
    population thinking….
