Overall notes
-------------

Murray’s conclusion is very thought provoking (as is Bailey’s chapter).

Murray lumps evolutionary archaeology in with the prevailing paradigm of
“archaeology as anthropology”, and that’s probably fair because although
we know we need a new metaphysic, and have described the
meta-theoretical requirements for one, we haven’t really produced one
yet. We keep slipping back into evolutionary ecological theory. Although
the cladistics work on branching of the cultural information flow might
warrant a serious re-look as one foundation of a timelike paradigm.

With respect to CT itself, the major challenge is to:

1.  Stop exclusively using models which require parameters we cannot
    estimate or measure, especially independently of each other (e.g.,
    N, or mu).

2.  Develop a time-like set of expectations for things we can actually
    measure.

3.  Build bridges between ecological time theory and those time-like
    expectations.

Current Thinking
----------------

A really basic problem is that folks have been trying to use CT models
that require ecological parameterization to say things about “how much
variation we should expect” in the record. And then making claims about
CT processes and thus social aspects of past societies based upon
deviations from those expectations.

But we haven’t demonstrated that we can securely tie “how much variation
to expect” to both a model and the record.

-   This gets to empirical insufficiency (and thus dynamic
    insufficiency) of models
-   Impedance mismatch between models and the record – time
    perspectivism/time-like vs. space-like.
-   Lack of proper focus on unit formation and how units, time scales,
    and model quantities interact

Investigate: 1. Models where we don’t need to know N and mu, and instead
look at “how much variation” there is depending upon time scale of
observation and granularity of classification – at at least three levels
of granularity to establish scaling relations 1. Take an explicitly
statistical physical view of these scaling relationships – we’re looking
for “phase transitions” and difference phases of behavior in these
scaling relationships; models which have the same scaling behavior
ultimately can’t be differentiated in a time-perspective record and are
thus equifinal.

The central problem is defining **CT models which do not require
parameters unrecoverable from archaeological sources, and which have
direct empirical implication for palimpsest deposits**, given
flexibility on things like determining deposit duration, choosing
classificatory schemes (and possibly more than one).

The result may not be able to make predictions about any specific
assemblage, but should be able to make predictions about sets of
assemblages relative to one another – flows within metacommunities over
time.

Richness itself is highly affected by time-averaging in palimpsests,
evenness affected but less so. What we need to study is the scaling of
sets of richness and evenness values across groups of assemblages.
