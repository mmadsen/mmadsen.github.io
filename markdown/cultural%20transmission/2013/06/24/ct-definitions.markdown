### Culture and Cultural Transmission

### CT Models

Definition from my colloquium, that I adapted from William Harms’s
(2004) *Information and Meaning in Evolutionary Processes*:

> Cultural transmission models describe the dynamics of the distribution
> of acquired behavioral traits and artifacts, with an emphasis on the
> role that imitation and population structure plays in shaping this
> dynamics.

My point in the above is to differentiate between individual-level and
population-level phenomena. Our *models* of cultural transmission are
dynamical systems, and describe changes in statistical and
distributional measures given a specific set of individual-level state
variables and processes.

But the focus on “imitation” is misleading, given how much of social
learning is non-imitative. So a better definition might be:

> Cultural transmission models describe the distribution of behavioral
> traits and artifacts, given their acquisition through mechanisms of
> social learning, within contexts that encompass spatial and social
> structures.

But we also want to recognize that while models of social learning
always describe individual-level dynamics (or rather,
individual-in-group dynamics), cultural transmission models can be
pitched to model dynamics at different scales. The scale we normally
think of as “microevolutionary” is really the short-term dynamics,
usually within a population or set of populations. But we can think on
longer time scales and larger spatial scales as well, and end up with
models which are “macroevolutionary.” We tend to use the mathematics of
diffusion to describe the former, and phylogenetic models relying upon
graph theory to describe the latter, but these are modeling choices.

> Cultural transmission models describe the distribution or history of
> behavioral traits and artifacts, given their acquisition through
> mechanisms of social learning, at a particular scale of observation.
