<p>He and Stone (2003) analyze the conditions under which there is large scale “in phase” versus “anti-phase” synchronization between communities in a local metapopulation. They don’t really model the details of a complex network, in section 2 AFAIK they’re randomly assigning links, which means that the intra-population network is going to be an ER graph.</p>
<p>They use a control parameter, the “link ratio,” which measures the number of inter-population links over the number of intra-population links (or, the fraction of edges in the overall network which cross populations).</p>
<p>The order parameter is the phase difference between populations, where the “phase” of an infection is Pikovsky et al.’s (2001) equation for the phase of a time series, given parameters which seem to be various ordered “maxima” of the time series (NEED TO EXAMINE).</p>
<p>This is starting to make sense in terms of how to calculate the “synchronization” of something like a spreading process which fundamentally isn’t a strict oscillator (without dealing with the complications involved in a full chaotic oscillator model, or maybe it is….?)</p>
<p>The basic conclusion here is that low levels of coupling (i.e., low LR) tend to lead to anti-phase synchronization, and high levels of coupling bring the population into strict synchronization. In-phase synch gives an order parameter near zero, while strict anti-phase sync leads to an OP of pi.</p>

<p>Several questions arise.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All of the inphase/anti-phase stuff here is very short-term. There still is a renormalization aspect to figure out what survives when we “zoom out”….</li>
<li>How do we connect the <em>failure</em> to include assemblage A into a seriation with assemblages B-G (as an example), with the order parameter for phase differences?<br /></li>
<li>When we order assemblages via seriation, we’re actually putting one <em>before</em> another, which is a statement of how two assemblages relate temporally (or spatiotemporally), so technically we’re making a statement that B and C are not “strictly contemporaneous,” and our phase synchronization stuff here presumes that communities are strictly contemporaneous.</li>
</ol>
<p>SO, I need to examine the longer-term empirical studies, on measles, and look at how things synchronize when we look at longer spans of time (over a human lifetime).</p>
